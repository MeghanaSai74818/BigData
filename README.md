## Document Summarization using Latent Semantic Analysis

- Description: In this project, I implemented Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) to summarize documents from the BBC News Summary dataset. Leveraging the power of MapReduce and utilizing NLTK libraries on Databricks, I conducted efficient analysis on the dataset. LSA allowed me to extract underlying latent topics from the documents, enabling a concise summary. To ensure scalability and accessibility, I published the results on AWS S3, making it convenient for further analysis or sharing. By combining LSA, MapReduce, and NLTK, this project showcased the ability to process large amounts of text data, extract meaningful insights, and disseminate the summarized information on a cloud platform.


## Sentiment Analysis on Tweets

- Description: In this project, I conducted sentiment analysis on real-time Twitter data related to COVID-19 using Spark Streaming and Kafka. By leveraging the power of Spark Streaming, I was able to process the streaming tweets and extract valuable insights regarding the sentiments expressed. Utilizing Hugging Face's Transformers library, I performed sentiment analysis to classify the tweets into positive, or negative sentiments. To enable comprehensive analysis and visualization, I integrated Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana. This integration allowed me to store the analyzed data in Elasticsearch and visualize it using Kibana, providing a comprehensive overview of the sentiment trends related to COVID-19 on Twitter in real-time.


## Stock Price Prediction using LSTM from Scratch 

- Description: In this project, I implemented machine learning technique, specifically LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) from scratch, to predict stock market prices using historical data from the Yahoo Finance API for JPMorgan Chase & Co. By leveraging these techniques, I aimed to forecast future stock prices based on past trends. To evaluate the performance of the models, I used error functions such as RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error), MSE (Mean Squared Error), and MAE (Mean Absolute Error). After rigorous evaluation, it was concluded that LSTM outperformed sklearn's Random Forest Regressor in predicting stock market prices. This project demonstrated the effectiveness of LSTM in forecasting stock prices based on historical data.
